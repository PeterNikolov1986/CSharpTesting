I. C# TESTS - BANK ACCOUNT

Create a bank account's class with methods for deposit and withdrawal of money. The creation of the withdrawal's method has
to be complied with 2 main conditions:

o	If the withdrawal's amount is less than 1000, the transfer fee must be 5% of the withdrawn sum;
o	If the withdrawal's amount is greater than 1000, the transfer fee must be 2% of the withdrawn sum.

Write some tests in C# against the bank account's class, that test its functionality. Don't forget to check the following
important test scenarios: 

•	When you initialize the bank account with negative sum, there should be thrown an argument exception;
•	The withdrawal's method gets the right amount of money for a bank transfer.


II. ASSERTS

You can assert so much things. There is no "right" way to assert something. It is up to you to choose how to assert. Use at 
least 5 different type of asserts for these tests, using unit testing framework.
